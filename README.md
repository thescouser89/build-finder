# Build Finder

[Build Finder](https://github.com/project-ncl/build-finder/) iterates
over any files or directories in the input, recursively scanning any
supported (possibly compressed) archive types, locating the associated
Koji or PNC build for each file matching any given Koji archive type. It
attempts to find at least one Koji build containing the file checksum
(duplicate builds result in a warning) and records files that don't have
any corresponding Koji build to a file. For files with a corresponding
Koji build, if the Koji build does not have a corresponding Koji task,
it reports the build as an *import*. For builds with a corresponding
Koji task, it writes information about the build to a file.
Additionally, it writes various reports about the builds.

## Development

[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is used for the building. The
command `mvn clean install` will compile the code and run the unit
tests.

To run, the integration tests, you need a
`${user.home}/.build-finder/config.json` file with valid settings for
`koji-hub-url` and `pnc-url`. Then, run the command `mvn -DskipITs=false
-Ddistribution.url=<url> clean install` where `<url>` points to the
distribution file (`.ear`, `.zip`, etc.) that you want to use for
testing.

If the build fails due to problems with file formatting:

* To format the `pom.xml` files, run `mvn
  com.github.ekryd.sortpom:sortpom-maven-plugin:sort`.

* To format the source code, run `mvn
  net.revelc.code.formatter:formatter-maven-plugin:format`.

* To sort the Java `import` statements, run `mvn
  net.revelc.code:impsort-maven-plugin:sort`.

## Operation

The support for various compressed archive types relies on
[Apache Commons VFS](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-vfs/) and
the compressor and archive formats that Commons VFS can open
*automatically*. If an exception occurs while trying to open a file,
then the file is considered to be a normal file and recursive processing
of the file is aborted.

The default supported Koji archive types are `jar`, `xml`, `pom`, `so`,
`dll`, and `dylib`. Build Finder uses
[Koji Java Interface](https://github.com/release-engineering/kojiji) for
Koji support and asks for all known extensions for the given Koji
archive type name. Note that if you specify no Koji archive types, Build
Finder will ask the Koji server for all known Koji archive types. The
default set of types is meant to give a reasonable default, particularly
for Java-based distributions.

Build Finder operates in three stages:

1. Checksums are calculated offline for all files in the distribution,
   including files inside archives. Checksum information is stored in
   JSON format.

2. An online Koji archive lookup in performed for each checksum in stage
   one and the respective archive, if found, is mapped to the
   corresponding Koji build. The build is either an *import* and has no
   corresponding Koji task information or is *built from source* and
   includes corresponding Koji task information. Build information is
   stored in JSON format.

3. Reports are generated from the archive and build information gathered
   in the first two stages. The format of the reports is HTML and/or
   text.

### Running via Docker containers

There is a `Dockerfile` and a `Makefile` supplied in the code
repository. If you are unfamiliar with Java-based projects, you can
easily create a container image and run Build Finder in a Fedora Linux
container by executing the following commands in a shell:
1. Build the container image:

```
$ make build
```

2. Invoke shell in the container so you can try the tool out:

```
$ make shell
# java -jar target/build-finder-<version>.jar
```

where `<version>` should be replaced with the current version of the
software.

## Getting Started

On the first run, Build Finder will write a starter configuration file.
You may optionally edit this file by hand, but you do not need to create
it ahead of time as Build Finder will create a default configuration
file if none exists.


### Configuration file format

The configuration file is in JSON format. The default configuration
file, `config.json`, is as follows.

    {
      "archive-extensions" : [ "dll", "dylib", "ear", "jar", "jdocbook", "jdocbook-style", "kar", "plugin", "pom", "rar", "sar", "so", "war", "xml" ],
      "archive-types" : [ "jar", "xml", "pom", "so", "dll", "dylib" ],
      "build-systems" : [ "pnc", "koji" ],
      "cache-lifespan" : 3600000,
      "cache-max-idle" : 3600000,
      "checksum-only" : false,
      "checksum-type" : [ "sha1", "sha256", "md5" ],
      "disable-cache" : false,
      "disable-recursion" : false,
      "excludes" : [ "^(?!.*/pom\\.xml$).*/.*\\.xml$" ],
      "koji-multicall-size" : 8,
      "koji-num-threads" : 12,
      "output-directory" : ".",
      "pnc-num-threads" : 10,
      "pnc-partition-size" : 18,
      "use-builds-file" : false,
      "use-checksums-file" : false
    }

The `archive-extensions` option specifies the Koji archive type
extensions to include in the archive search. If this option is given, it
will override the `archive-types` option and only files matching the
extensions will have their checksums taken.

The `archive-types` option specifies the Koji archive types to include
in the archive search.

The `build-system` option specifies the build systems to use for search.

The `cache-lifespan` option specifies the cache entry lifespan in
milliseconds.

The `cache-max-idle` option specifies the cache entry maximum idle time
in milliseconds.

The `checksum-only` option specifies whether or not to skip the Koji
build lookup stage and only checksum the files in the input. This stage
is performed offline, whereas the build lookup stage is online.

The `checksum-type` option specifies the checksum type to use for
lookups. Note that at this time Koji can only support a single checksum
type in its database, `md5`, even though the Koji API currently provides
additional support for `sha256` and `sha512` checksum types.

The `disable-cache` option disables the local infinispan cache for
checksums and builds.

The `disable-recursion` option disables recursion when examining
archives.

The `excludes` option is list of regular expression patterns. Any paths
that match any of these patterns will be excluded during the
build-lookup stage search.

The `koji-multicall-size` option sets the Koji multicall size.

The `koji-num-threads` option sets the number of Koji threads.

The `koji-hub-url` and `koji-web-url` options must be set to valid URLs
for your particular network.

The `pnc-num-threads` signifies how many threads will be used to
communicate with PNC when finding builds.

The `pnc-partition-size` option sets the Pnc partition size.

The `pnc-url` option must be set to a valid URL for your particular
network if you want Pnc support.

The `output-directory` option specifies the directory to use for output.

The `use-checksums-file` and `use-builds-file` options specify whether
to load any existing `checksums.json` or `builds.json` file,
respectively. These files are always written, but not loaded by default.

All of the options found in the configuration file can also be specified
and overridden via command-line options.

### Command-line options

The `koji-*-url` options are the only required command-line options (if
not specified in the configuration file) and these options specify the
URLs for the Koji server. If running Build Finder for the first time,
you should pass these options so that they are written to the
configuration file.

The `krb-*` options are used for logging in via Kerberos as opposed to
via SSL as it does not require the additional setup of SSL certificates.
Note that the [Apache Kerby](https://directory.apache.org/kerby/)
library is used to supply Kerberos functionality. As such, interaction
with the other Kerberos implementations, such as the canonical MIT
Kerberos implementation, may not work with the `krb-ccache` or
`krb-keytab` options. The `krb-principal` and `krb-password` options are
expected to always work, but care should be taken to protect your
password. Note that when using the `krb-*` options, the `krb-service`
option is necessary in order for Kerberos login to work.

### Execution

After optionally completing setup of the configuration file,
`config.json`, you can run the software with a command as follows.

    java -jar build-finder-<version>.jar /path/to/distribution.zip

where `<version>` is the current version of the software and
`/path/to/distribution.zip` is the path to the file that you wish to
examine. In this execution, Build Finder will read through the file
`distribution.zip`, trying to match each file entry against a build in
the Koji database provided that the file name matches one of the
specified Koji archive types and does not match the exclusion pattern.

On the first completed run, the software will create a
`checksum-<checksum-type>.json` file to cache the file checksums and a
`builds.json` file to cache the Koji build information. Currently, if
you wish to perform a clean run, you must *manually* remove the JSON
files. Otherwise, the cache will be loaded and the information will not
be recalculated. Alternatively, you may specify a different output
directory for each run using the `--output-directory` option.

## Output File Formats

This section describes the JSON files used for caching the distribution
information between runs in more detail.

### Checksums

The `checksum-md5.json` file contains a map where the key is the MD5
checksum of the file and the value is a list of all files with the
checksum. Note that it is possible to have more than one file with the
given checksum. For completeness, the `checksum-md5.json` file contains
every single file found in the input, including any files found by
recursively scanning compressed files or inside archive files.

### Builds

The `builds.json` file contains a map where the key is the Koji build
ID. The special ID of 0 is used for files with no associated build, as
Koji builds start at ID 1. The map values contain additional maps. A
partial list of what is contained is in the value maps is: Koji Build
Info, Koji Task Info, Koji Task Request, Koji Archive, a list of all
remote archives associated with the build and a list of local files from
the distribution associated with this build.

## Reports

After a completed run, several output files are produced in the current
directory. These files are overwritten on additional runs, so if the
output files need to be saved between multiple runs, then specify unique
directories for each run.

### Builds Report

This is an HTML-based report located in the file `output.html`. It
contains all Koji builds found as well as any problems associated with
the builds.

#### Problems flagged

The report currently reports total builds, including number of builds
that are *imports*. Additionally, it reports:

* Matching files with no Koji build associated. These are potentially
  files that need to be rebuilt from source, for example, a dynamic
  library downloaded from upstream during the build process.

* Builds that are *imports* and not built from source. These represent
  files which, as they are builds with a known community import in the
  Koji database, almost certainly need to be built from source and/or
  removed from the distribution if not required at runtime. These often
  appear inside shaded jars and the like.

### Statistics Report

This is an HTML-based report which displays various statistics about the
distribution, including the number and percentage of builds and
artifacts built from source. Note that the total number of artifacts
includes *not-found* artifacts. If you wish to exclude these not-found
artifacts, use the `--excludes` option with the appropriate pattern(s).

### Products Report

This is an HTML-based report which displays the list of builds
partitioned by product (Koji build target). Note that the report tries
to find a minimal set of products which cover the set of builds.
Therefore, there will only be one product shown per build, even if the
build appears in multiple products.

### Koji builds (NVR) Report

This is a text-based report located in the file `nvr.txt`. The format of
the file is one `name-version-release` per line, as is typical with Koji
native builds and RPMS.

### Maven artifacts (GAV) Report

This is a text-based report located in the file `gav.txt`. The format of
the file is one `groupId:artifactId:version` per line, as is typical
with Maven builds.
